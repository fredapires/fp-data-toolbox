# **pipenv_to_poetry_transition**

<br>

## Prompt

---

I've got a python environment built in a .venv in my project folder. This evironment was built with  the python package  `pipenv`, but I  would like to move to poetry for package management.
Can you help me think through the most logical stepwise way to transition  everything? I need to uninstall the existing venv, translate the Pipfile to a pyproject.toml, and then reinstall the venv with the same packages

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a step-by-step guide to transition from pipenv to poetry:

<br>

Backup your project: Before making any changes, it's a good idea to make a backup of your project folder or use version control to track your changes.

<br>

Install poetry: If you haven't already, install poetry using the following command:

```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

This will install poetry on your system. You can also follow the official installation guide: <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>

<br><br><br>

Deactivate the existing virtual environment: If your .venv environment is active, deactivate it using the following command:

```
deactivate
```

<br>

Remove the existing virtual environment: Delete the .venv directory in your project folder.

```
rm -rf .venv
```

<br>

Generate a pyproject.toml file: Run the following command in your project folder:

```
poetry init
```

<br>

This will create a pyproject.toml file and guide you through the process of setting up your project's metadata. You can also manually create the pyproject.toml file and add the necessary information, including the package dependencies.

<br>

Translate Pipfile to pyproject.toml: Open your Pipfile and copy the package dependencies from the [packages] and [dev-packages] sections to the newly created pyproject.toml file.

Add the packages under [tool.poetry.dependencies] and [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies] sections in the pyproject.toml file. For example, if your Pipfile looks like this:

```
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
requests = "*"
numpy = "*"

[dev-packages]
pytest = "*"
```

<br>

Your pyproject.toml should look like this:

```
[tool.poetry]
name = "your-project-name"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Your project description"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.9"
requests = "*"
numpy = "*"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pytest = "*"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
Replace the placeholders with your project's specific details.
```

<br>

Remove the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock: After you've transferred the dependencies, you can safely remove the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files:

```
rm Pipfile Pipfile.lock
```

Create and activate the new virtual environment: Run the following command to create a new virtual environment using poetry and install the dependencies:

```
poetry install
```

<br>

To activate the virtual environment, run:

```
poetry shell
```

<br>

Now you have successfully transitioned from pipenv to poetry.
