def setup():
    """
    The setup function sets up notifications for the jupyter_helpers library by defining a WindowsIntegration class 
    that uses the win10toast library to display notifications, and instantiating the Notifications class with the 
    WindowsIntegration class as the integration. The time_threshold parameter is also set to 60 seconds, meaning that 
    notifications will only be shown if the time since the last notification is greater than 60 seconds.

    Parameters:
    None

    Returns:
    None
